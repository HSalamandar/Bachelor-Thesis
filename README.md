# Bachelor-Thesis
Conducted Sentiment Analysis for my thesis: “Cross-Cultural Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Food Applications."
explored the differences in customer sentiments in reviews of food applications between Egypt
 and the United States. Leveraging sentiment analysis and a Google Play scraper, I extracted and
 analyzed reviews from two different food applications. Utilized a Naïve Bayes model, and TF-IDF. I evaluated
 various aspects such as food quality, service, price, and app performance. Evaluated and deployed the two countries' sentiment analysis by extracting the Accuracy, Percision and Recall
